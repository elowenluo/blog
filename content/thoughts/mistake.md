Mistakes are valuable learning opportunities. During my student years, I learned from errors I made in exams, homework, and various other areas. However, I rarely cataloged these mistakes systematically and was reluctant to confront them directly. After entering the workforce,  I came to appreciate their significance, but now I find it difficult to identify my own shortcomings, which has consequently led to a slowdown in my personal development.
